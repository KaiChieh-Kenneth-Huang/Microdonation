                <h3>What your dollars can do</h3>
                <p>
                    As the humanitarian situation in Gaza continued to decline, we shared meals providing 1,600 children with food for 1 year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Yemen faced the world's largest hunger crisis, your shared meals supported Yemeni families, many of which relied on humanitarian aid to eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, we helped provide 9,000 South Sudanese refugees living in Uganda with food for one month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A decade long crisis in NE Nigeria left 2.9 million people food insecure. Your shared meals helped us reach our goal of providing critical food assistance within these communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your shared meals helped us provide emergency support in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You've helped us reach our goal in Palestine! This will support WFP in providing food assistance to about 300,000 of the poorest Palestinians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of your generosity, we can ensure that 2,100 children in Yemen will receive lifesaving food for 1 year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, we've reached our goal of feeding 2,500 children in rural Damascus, Syria for 1 year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WFP is now providing storage containers and food to 20 schools, aiming to make school meals healthier for the children and ensure there is enough food throughout the year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for helping to feed 1,000 Syrian refugee children in Jordan for 1 year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With your help, 8,000 children in Haiti will receive proper nutrition in the upcoming school year.
