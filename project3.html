                <h3>What your dollars can do</h3>
                <p>
                    When you give to Bread for the World, your gift is multiplied. For every dollar you donate, Bread helps win more than $100 in federal government assistance for hungry and poor people in the U.S. and around the world through its advocacy before Congress. When you donate, you also become a Bread member.

                    CHILDREN
                    Children are often hit hardest when it comes to hunger. Bread has always been committed to strengthening programs that provide children to the meals and nutrition they need. Over the years, we’ve helped secure better nutrition, increased access to meals, clearer nutrition guidelines, and increased funding for programs like WIC and those for school breakfasts and lunches and summer feeding.

                    SNAP
                    The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly called food stamps) is the primary way our government helps American families put food on the table when budgets are tight. Bread has successfully supported improvements and reforms to SNAP over the years. These changes allow the program to do exactly it was designed to do: be a safety net for families in times of need.

                    INTERNATIONAL
                    Bread has always held a concern about hunger both at home and abroad. Its advocacy on international hunger has helped developing countries adopt better farming practices. It has pushed our government to provide smarter foreign aid and emergency food. Our goal is for the U.S. to be a partner in helping other countries to become self-reliant. We do this by advocating for common sense programs with a proven track record so that U.S. tax dollars are spent wisely.

                    TAX CREDITS
                    When it comes to mechanisms that fight hunger, you might not think of the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the child tax credit (CTC). But these measures are proven to be the most successful at moving American families out of poverty. Supporting programs like these, which help families feed themselves, is an important part of working toward our mission to end hunger.
