            <h3>What your dollars can do</h3>
            <p>
                In 2018, we worked closely with a school district in Illinois to serve breakfast after the bell, as a part of the regular school day. Through our efforts and the funds we granted, a lot more students started their day fueled up and ready to reach their full potential. In fact, the district served an additional 79,500 breakfasts that year. That works out to 20 meals per dollar we invested on behalf of our donors.
            </p>
            <p>
                We paired our expert insights with a grant to help a district in Texas start serving afterschool meals. They served an incredible 178,000 additional meals in 2018, sending students home with the nutrients needed to tackle homework and extracurriculars. One donated dollar provided nearly 36 meals for hungry kids in that case â€“ meals those kids might not have received at home otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                We teamed up with a community group in Arkansas that same year to offer free summer meals in low-income neighborhoods and make sure families knew about them. That summer, the group served more than 65,000 meals to hungry kids, making our investment add up to about 10 meals for every dollar spent.
